Didn't encrypt or Weak encryption -> then data breaches can happen.
can encrpyted password cant be decrypted.....

we use salt .... to encrypt so that hacker gets the wrong answer whle decrypting....

md5 -> always 1 to many ...

there can be collissions also...

abc -> xyz
abcabc -> xyz

probality of encrpytion colliding is very rear...
even salts only changing....

salts are stored in different table

Rsa Tokens :
    Absouletly not connected to the internet..
    Unique code every 10s.

    How does this work ?

    token based 2FA

    maharanaa pratap
    time series function -> userId -> timeSeries ......hardcoded based on time -> offline auths.

SSO -> login through 3rd party apis
scaler -> google -> login -> auth -> scaler (userId, token)

Authorization and Authentication

Session :
    stateless software
    -> remembering the user.......  -> token stored in cookie
    -> token is send in every request....
    -> validate the user...


    -> storing the token in cookie is not secure ...
